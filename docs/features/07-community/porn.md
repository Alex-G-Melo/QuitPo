**Trigger Survived:**

**Flatline Question:**
> Anonymous • 8h • Day 35

## Comment Examples

### Supportive Comments

**On struggle post:**
> Anonymous • Day 67 • 4h
>
> I've been there at 2 AM. What helps me: get out of bed, go to a different room, do the 4-7-8 breathing. The urge can't last forever. You've got this.
> ▲ 18

**On relapse post:**
> Anonymous • Day 90+ • 2h
>
> 21 days wasn't "blown" - those neural pathways you built are still there. Your brain remembers the healing. This is a setback, not the end. Day 1 again, but not from zero.
> ▲ 24
