## Comment Examples

### Supportive Comments

**On FOMO post:**
> Anonymous • Day 60 • 3h
>
> Here's the truth about FOMO: nothing on that feed is as important as your life right now. The event will be forgotten in a week. Your presence is the real event. You're not missing anything - you're gaining everything.
> ▲ 28

**On comparison spiral:**
> Anonymous • Day 45 • 2h
>
> Those "perfect" lives are curated highlight reels. The same people posting that stuff are also struggling with their own issues. Nobody's life is as good as their feed. Close the app and live YOUR life.
