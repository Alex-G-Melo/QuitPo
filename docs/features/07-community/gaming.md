## Comment Examples

### Supportive Comments

**On friends pressure:**
> Anonymous • Day 90+ • 2h
>
> Real friends will understand eventually. Some gaming friends are only gaming friends - and that's okay to recognize. You might be surprised who sticks around when you suggest real-world hangouts instead.
> ▲ 31

**On boredom:**
> Anonymous • Day 60 • 3h
>
> Yes, it gets better. Your brain is used to constant stimulation. Real life feels slow at first. But after a few weeks, real activities start to feel satisfying. The boredom is temporary - push through it.
