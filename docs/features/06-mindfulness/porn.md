## Meditation Scripts (Porn-Specific)

### Urge Surfing (5 min)

**Introduction:**
> "Welcome. You're feeling an urge right now, and that's okay. This urge is not you - it's your brain's old wiring seeking a familiar dopamine hit. We're going to surf this wave together, watching it rise and fall without getting pulled under."

**Body Scan Phase:**
> "Notice where you feel the urge in your body. Is it in your chest? Your stomach? Your groin? Don't judge these sensations - just notice them. Your body has been conditioned to respond this way. We're going to gently rewire it."

**Wave Metaphor:**
> "Imagine this urge as a wave in the ocean. Right now, it's building. You can feel its power. But here's what you need to know: every wave peaks and then falls. No wave lasts forever. Your job isn't to fight the wave - it's to stay on your surfboard and ride it out."

**Peak Awareness:**
> "Notice the intensity right now. On a scale of 1 to 10, where is it? Whatever the number, know this: it will decrease. The average urge peaks at about 15 minutes and then subsides. You've already made it this far."

**Release Phase:**
> "Now notice the urge beginning to shift. It might not disappear completely, but it's changing. You're not the urge - you're the awareness observing it. You've proven, right now, that you can feel this without acting on it. That's neural rewiring in action."

**Closing:**
> "Take a deep breath. You surfed this wave. Every time you do this, you strengthen new neural pathways. Your brain is healing. You're not just resisting - you're rebuilding. Well done."

### Self-Compassion After Slip (7 min)

**Introduction:**
> "You're here because you slipped. First, take a breath. The fact that you're doing this meditation shows strength, not weakness. Your brain was hijacked by a powerful addiction, and today it won. But this journey isn't over."

**Acknowledging Reality:**
> "Let's be honest about what happened. You watched porn. Maybe for minutes, maybe for hours. Whatever the duration, it happened. We're not going to pretend otherwise, and we're not going to beat yourself up about it either."

**Self-Forgiveness Phase:**
> "Put your hand on your heart. Feel it beating. This heart has been through so much - the shame, the guilt, the promises broken. But it's still beating. You're still here. And that means you can still heal.
>
> Repeat after me in your mind: 'I forgive myself for this slip. I am human, and humans struggle. My worth is not defined by my worst moments. I am learning. I am healing.'"

**Understanding Without Excusing:**
> "What led to this slip? Was it stress? Loneliness? Boredom? Late night? Knowing your triggers isn't an excuse - it's information. Information helps you build a better defense next time."

**Recommitment Phase:**
> "You are not starting from zero. Your days of freedom weren't erased. Your brain still has those new pathways you built. Relapse is part of recovery for many people - what matters is what you do next.
>
> Right now, in this moment, choose to recommit. Not forever - that's too big. Just for today. Just for this hour. Can you stay free for the next hour? Yes. You can."

**Closing:**
> "You've just done something powerful. Instead of spiraling into shame, you chose self-compassion. That takes courage. Take a deep breath. Let the shame go with the exhale. Tomorrow is waiting. You've got this."

### Dealing with Triggers (6 min)

**Introduction:**
> "We're going to practice responding to triggers - those moments when something you see, feel, or think pushes you toward pornography. The goal isn't to never be triggered - that's impossible. The goal is to create space between trigger and response."

**Identifying Triggers:**
> "Think about your most common triggers. Maybe it's a certain app, a certain time of day, or being alone with your phone at night. Maybe it's stress at work or conflict with someone you love. These triggers have been paired with pornography so many times that the connection feels automatic."

**Creating Space:**
> "But automatic doesn't mean inevitable. There's a moment - often just a fraction of a second - between trigger and action. We're going to stretch that moment. We're going to create space for choice.
>
> Imagine you've just been triggered. You feel that pull. Now, instead of acting, take a breath. In this breath, you're creating space. In this space, you have power."

**The STOP Technique:**
> "When triggered, use STOP:
> - S: See the trigger. Name it. 'I'm being triggered by loneliness.'
> - T: Take a breath. This is your pause.
> - O: Observe your options. What can you do instead?
> - P: Proceed mindfully. Choose your next action consciously."

**Practice Visualization:**
> "Let's practice. Visualize a common trigger... See it clearly... Feel the pull starting... Now, STOP. Breathe. Name what's happening. Feel the space you've created. Choose something else. Maybe you open this app, call a friend, or go for a walk. You chose. You didn't react. You responded."

**Closing:**
> "Triggers will keep coming. That's life. But now you have a tool. STOP. Breathe. Choose. Every time you use this tool, you weaken the old pathway and strengthen the new one. Your brain is healing, one choice at a time."

## Science Integration

Explain the science behind mindfulness for porn recovery:

**Why Breathing Helps:**
> "Deep breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system - the 'rest and digest' mode. This counteracts the 'fight or flight' response that urges create. By breathing, you're literally telling your brain 'we're safe, we don't need that dopamine hit.'"

**Why Urge Surfing Works:**
> "Urges typically peak at 15-20 minutes and then subside. By observing without acting, you prove to your brain that urges don't have to be obeyed. Each time you surf, you weaken the addiction pathway and strengthen your self-control pathway."

**Why Self-Compassion Matters:**
> "Shame and guilt are major relapse drivers. People who beat themselves up after a slip are MORE likely to relapse again - it's called the 'what the hell' effect. Self-compassion breaks this cycle and gives you the mental space to recommit."
