## Meditation Scripts (Social Media-Specific)

### Urge Surfing (5 min)

**Introduction:**
> "Welcome. You're feeling the pull to check your phone, to scroll, to see what you're 'missing.' That's okay - this urge is your brain's conditioning. Social apps are designed to create this craving. We're going to surf this wave together, watching it rise and fall without opening an app."

**Body Scan Phase:**
> "Notice where you feel the urge in your body. Is your hand reaching for your phone? Is there anxiety about what you might be missing? Do you feel restless, like you need stimulation? These are the physical sensations of digital craving. Don't judge them - just notice."

**FOMO Acknowledgment:**
> "You might be thinking: 'What if something important happened? What if everyone is talking about something and I'm missing it?' Let me tell you something true: you're not missing anything real. The feeds will look the same in an hour. Nothing there is as important as this moment right now."

**Wave Metaphor:**
> "Imagine this urge as a wave. It's building - you feel the pull to check. But here's what those apps don't want you to know: every urge peaks and then falls. If you don't check, the feeling passes. The algorithm wants you to believe checking is urgent. It's not."

**Presence Redirect:**
> "Right now, look around you. What's in your physical space? What sounds do you hear? What does the air feel like? This - right here - is your life. Not the one in the screen. The people who post their 'perfect lives' are also looking at screens instead of living."

**Release Phase:**
> "Notice the urge shifting. You didn't check, and you're still okay. Nothing exploded. The FOMO was a lie. You're here, present, alive. That's more than any notification can give you."

**Closing:**
> "Take a deep breath. You surfed the wave of digital distraction. Every time you do this, you reclaim a little more of your attention. You're not just resisting - you're rebuilding your ability to be present. Well done."

### Self-Compassion After Slip (7 min)

**Introduction:**
> "You're here because you fell into the scroll again. Maybe minutes turned to hours. Maybe you intended to 'just check' and emerged having wasted your evening. First, take a breath. You're not alone - these apps are designed by teams of psychologists to be addictive."

**Acknowledging Reality:**
> "Let's be honest about what happened. You scrolled. Maybe you compared yourself to others. Maybe you felt worse after than before. That's how it's designed to work - leaving you empty so you come back for more."

**Self-Forgiveness Phase:**
> "Put your hand on your heart. This heart has felt the FOMO, the comparison, the loneliness that drives you to scroll. But scrolling doesn't fill those holes - it deepens them.
>
> Repeat in your mind: 'I forgive myself for getting lost in the scroll. The apps are designed to capture attention. My worth is not measured in likes or followers. I am learning. I am healing.'"

**Understanding the Design:**
> "What pulled you in? Was it boredom? Loneliness? A notification? Social media companies spend billions making their products irresistible. You're not weak - you're fighting well-funded manipulation."

**Recommitment Phase:**
> "Your time is valuable. The hour you spent scrolling could have been spent on something real. But you can't get that time back - you can only choose what to do with the next hour. Right now, choose presence."

**Closing:**
> "You chose self-compassion over more scrolling. That's powerful. Take a breath. Put the phone down. Go do something in the physical world - anything. Your life is waiting outside the screen."

### Dealing with Triggers (6 min)

**Introduction:**
> "We're going to practice responding to the triggers that pull you back to social media. Maybe it's the notification sound. Maybe it's boredom. Maybe it's the habit of checking first thing in the morning. We're going to create space between trigger and scroll."

**Identifying Triggers:**
> "Think about when you reach for social media. Is it when you're waiting for something? When you're lonely? When you're avoiding something hard? In the morning before getting out of bed? At night instead of sleeping? Name your patterns."

**Creating Space:**
> "Between the urge to check and actually opening the app, there's a moment of choice. It might feel automatic, but it's not. We're going to stretch that moment. We're going to find the space where you choose presence over distraction."

**The STOP Technique:**
> "When you feel the pull, use STOP:
> - S: See the trigger. 'I'm feeling bored and reaching for my phone.'
> - T: Take a breath. This is your pause.
> - O: Observe your options. What could you do instead of scrolling?
> - P: Proceed mindfully. Put the phone down. Do something real."

**Attention Visualization:**
> "Visualize your attention as a precious resource. Every scroll steals a piece of it. Every notification fractures it. Now imagine your attention fully present - on a conversation, a book, a walk. Feel the difference. Full attention is rare now. It's valuable."

**Practice:**
> "Visualize a trigger moment... You're waiting in line... Your hand moves toward your pocket... STOP. Breathe. Look around you. Notice real people, real environment. Stay present. The phone doesn't need you. You're okay without checking."

**Closing:**
> "Triggers will keep coming - every notification, every moment of boredom. But now you have tools. STOP. Breathe. Choose presence. Every time you do, you reclaim a little more of your attention. That's real freedom."

## Science Integration

Explain the science behind mindfulness for attention recovery:

**Why Breathing Helps:**
> "Social media creates an anxious, distracted state - always checking, always alert for notifications. Deep breathing activates your calm nervous system. You're literally telling your brain 'we're safe, we don't need to check.'"

**Why Urge Surfing Works:**
> "The urge to check typically peaks and falls within minutes. By observing without checking, you prove the urge doesn't control you. Each time you surf, you weaken the compulsive checking habit."

**Why FOMO Is a Lie:**
> "FOMO feels like you're missing something important, but studies show people feel worse after checking social media, not better. The anxiety drives you to check, but checking doesn't reduce anxiety - it increases it. Breaking the cycle through mindfulness actually reduces FOMO over time."

**Attention Span Recovery:**
> "Constant scrolling fragments your attention. Mindfulness rebuilds it. Regular meditation practice has been shown to increase attention span, reduce mind-wandering, and improve the ability to focus on single tasks. Your attention can heal."
