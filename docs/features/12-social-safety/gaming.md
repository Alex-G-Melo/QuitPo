## Social Pressure Considerations

### The Guild/Clan Dilemma
Gaming social connections create powerful pressure:
- "The team needs me"
- "I'll let everyone down"
- "I'll miss out on events"

### Strategies for Social Ties
1. **Communicate honestly** - Tell gaming friends you're taking a break
2. **Find gaming friends elsewhere** - Some may want to do other things together
3. **Accept temporary distance** - Recovery may require space from gaming social circles
4. **Don't burn bridges** - You can reconnect later if you choose

### Message Templates
For telling gaming friends:
```
"Hey, I'm taking a break from gaming for a while
for personal reasons. I'll still be around for
non-gaming stuff. Talk soon."
```

```
"I need to step away from [game] for now.
Nothing personal - I'll let you know when
I'm back. Good luck with [raid/season/etc]!"
```
