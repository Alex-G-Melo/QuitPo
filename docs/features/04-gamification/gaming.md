## Recovery Parallels by Stage

### Stage 1: The Void (Days 0-4)
**Space Journey**: Lost in darkness, ship damaged, systems failing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *You've been lost in virtual worlds, chasing achievements that don't exist in real life, spending hours that turned into years. The game hijacked your reward system. You feel disconnected from the physical world, real accomplishments, real relationships. But a signal has been found. Your journey to balanced living begins now.*

**Alex's Message**: "I was lost in virtual worlds, chasing ranks that don't matter. You found me. Real life is already beginning to call. We're going home together."

---

### Stage 2: First Light (Days 5-6)
**Space Journey**: Ship systems coming online, life support stabilizing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *The controller is put down. You're noticing the physical world again - sunlight, fresh air, movement. Your body remembers what it's like to not be sedentary. Your brain is starting to find reward in real-world activities.*

**Alex's Message**: "Systems stabilizing. You went outside today. That's your body remembering real life. The hardest part - starting - is behind you."

---

### Stage 3: Leaving the Drift (Days 7-13)
**Space Journey**: Engines ignite, ship moving with purpose.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *A week of balanced living. You're discovering that time exists outside of game sessions, that achievement is possible in reality, that other people exist beyond your guild. Your brain is finding new dopamine sources.*

**Alex's Message**: "The engines are firing. Every day of balance builds momentum. The game world is behind us now. Real achievements await."

---

### Stage 4: The Asteroid Field (Days 14-29)
**Space Journey**: Navigating through dangerous debris, close calls.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Triggers are everywhere. New releases drop. Friends invite you to play. Updates roll out. FOMO about events and rankings hits hard. Each is an asteroid that could pull you back. But you're learning that games will wait - life won't.*

**Alex's Message**: "The asteroid field is dense. New releases, friend invites, that raid you're missing - triggers everywhere. But every one you navigate makes your real life stronger."

---

### Stage 5: The Nebula (Days 30-44)
**Space Journey**: Beautiful but disorienting fog, can't see far ahead.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Life might feel "boring" without the constant stimulation of games. Real achievements take longer. Progress is slower. Your brain is recalibrating to find satisfaction in real-world progress. This is the adjustment period.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're in the nebula. Life feels slow without the game. But this is healing - your brain learning that real achievements matter more than virtual ones."

---

### Stage 6: Clear Space (Days 45-59)
**Space Journey**: Emerging from fog, Earth visible as tiny blue dot.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Real-world skills are developing. Physical health is noticeably improved. You're finding hobbies, activities, achievements that exist in the physical world. Balance is visible on the horizon.*

**Alex's Message**: "There it is. Home. Real life. You can see it now. Your body is healthier. Your skills are real. Keep going."

---

### Stage 7: The Moon's Shadow (Days 60-74)
**Space Journey**: Moon in view, Earth growing larger, careful approach.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Balance feels natural. Gaming is becoming a choice, not a compulsion. Real relationships are fulfilling. But complacency is dangerous. One "quick session" can spiral into lost weeks. Stay vigilant.*

**Alex's Message**: "So close now. Balanced life, real achievements - they're right there. Don't let your guard down. The game doesn't control us anymore."

---

### Stage 8: Earth Orbit (Days 75-89)
**Space Journey**: Circling home, Earth fills the viewport.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Life is full without gaming dominating it. Real-world confidence is building. Physical health is restored. You're orbiting the life you want - active, present, achieving in reality.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're orbiting home. 90 days felt impossible once. Look at your real-world achievements. Look at the life you've built."

---

### Stage 9: Homecoming (Day 90+)
**Space Journey**: Landing on Earth, hatch opens, sunlight streams in.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Balance habits are solidified. Gaming is optional entertainment, not compulsive escape. Games will always exist, but your life is bigger than them now. Real achievements satisfy you. Real relationships fulfill you.*

**Alex's Message**: "The hatch opens. Real achievements. Real relationships. After 90 days, gaming is a choice, not a need. Welcome home."
