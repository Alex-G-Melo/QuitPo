## Recovery Parallels by Stage

### Stage 1: The Void (Days 0-4)
**Space Journey**: Lost in darkness, ship damaged, systems failing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *You've been chasing jackpots that never come, losing money you couldn't afford to lose. The thrill of the bet hijacked your brain's reward system. You feel lost in debt, shame, broken trust. But a signal has been found. Your journey to financial freedom begins now.*

**Alex's Message**: "I was lost chasing wins that never came. You found me. Your bank account is already beginning to heal. We're going home together."

---

### Stage 2: First Light (Days 5-6)
**Space Journey**: Ship systems coming online, life support stabilizing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Your first paycheck stayed in your pocket. Bills got paid. The constant anxiety about money is beginning to ease. Your brain is starting to find calm in stability instead of chaos in risk.*

**Alex's Message**: "Systems stabilizing. Money is staying where it belongs - with you. The hardest part - starting - is behind you."

---

### Stage 3: Leaving the Drift (Days 7-13)
**Space Journey**: Engines ignite, ship moving with purpose.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *A week without gambling. You're learning that you can watch sports without betting, see an ad without acting, pass a casino without entering. Your brain is finding new sources of excitement.*

**Alex's Message**: "The engines are firing. Every day of financial freedom builds momentum. The casino is behind us now."

---

### Stage 4: The Asteroid Field (Days 14-29)
**Space Journey**: Navigating through dangerous debris, close calls.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Triggers are everywhere. Payday arrives. Big games are on. Friends are betting. Gambling ads flood your feed. Each is an asteroid that could knock you off course. But you're learning to navigate without placing bets.*

**Alex's Message**: "The asteroid field is dense. Paydays, games, ads - triggers everywhere. But every one you navigate without betting makes you stronger."

---

### Stage 5: The Nebula (Days 30-44)
**Space Journey**: Beautiful but disorienting fog, can't see far ahead.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Life might feel "boring" without the thrill of the bet. The highs and lows of gambling are gone - replaced by steady calm. This feels strange at first. Your brain is recalibrating to find joy in stability, not risk.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're in the nebula. Life feels flat without the bet. But this is healing - your brain learning that peace is better than chaos."

---

### Stage 6: Clear Space (Days 45-59)
**Space Journey**: Emerging from fog, Earth visible as tiny blue dot.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Financial clarity is returning. Savings are growing. Debt is shrinking. Trust is rebuilding. You're starting to see what financial security looks like - a tiny blue dot of hope on the horizon.*

**Alex's Message**: "There it is. Home. Financial freedom. You can see it now. Your savings are growing. Keep going."

---

### Stage 7: The Moon's Shadow (Days 60-74)
**Space Journey**: Moon in view, Earth growing larger, careful approach.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *The casino's pull is weakening but still present. You've rebuilt trust with family. Bills are paid on time. But complacency is dangerous here. One "small bet" could undo months of progress.*

**Alex's Message**: "So close now. Financial security is right there. Don't let your guard down. The casino doesn't control us anymore."

---

### Stage 8: Earth Orbit (Days 75-89)
**Space Journey**: Circling home, Earth fills the viewport.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Money management is becoming automatic. The thrill of the bet has been replaced by the satisfaction of stability. You're orbiting the life you want - debt-free, trusted, secure.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're orbiting home. 90 days felt impossible once. Look at your savings. Look at the trust you've rebuilt."

---

### Stage 9: Homecoming (Day 90+)
**Space Journey**: Landing on Earth, hatch opens, sunlight streams in.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Financial habits are solidified. The chase is over. You've proven you can live without the bet. The casino will always exist, but you don't need it anymore. Real excitement comes from real life now.*

**Alex's Message**: "The hatch opens. Financial security. Rebuilt trust. After 90 days, you're free from the chase. Welcome home."
