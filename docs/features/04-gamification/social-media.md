## Recovery Parallels by Stage

### Stage 1: The Void (Days 0-4)
**Space Journey**: Lost in darkness, ship damaged, systems failing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *You've been lost in infinite scroll, attention scattered across feeds, always checking, never present. The algorithm hijacked your brain's reward system. You feel disconnected from real life, real moments. But a signal has been found. Your journey to presence begins now.*

**Alex's Message**: "I was lost in the scroll, attention scattered across a thousand feeds. You found me. Your focus is already beginning to heal. We're going home together."

---

### Stage 2: First Light (Days 5-6)
**Space Journey**: Ship systems coming online, life support stabilizing.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *The constant urge to check is beginning to fade. You're noticing moments of sustained focus. Phantom vibrations are less frequent. Your brain is starting to remember what stillness feels like.*

**Alex's Message**: "Systems stabilizing. You had a moment of real focus today. That's your attention span healing. The hardest part - starting - is behind you."

---

### Stage 3: Leaving the Drift (Days 7-13)
**Space Journey**: Engines ignite, ship moving with purpose.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *A week of presence. You're learning that you don't need to document every moment, check every notification, scroll every feed. Your brain is finding reward in real experiences.*

**Alex's Message**: "The engines are firing. Every day of presence strengthens your attention. The infinite scroll is behind us now."

---

### Stage 4: The Asteroid Field (Days 14-29)
**Space Journey**: Navigating through dangerous debris, close calls.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *FOMO is strong. Notifications call. Friends are posting. You wonder what you're missing. Each urge is an asteroid that could knock you off course. But you're learning that you're not missing anything - you're gaining everything.*

**Alex's Message**: "The asteroid field is dense. FOMO, notifications, that urge to check - triggers everywhere. But every one you navigate makes your attention stronger."

---

### Stage 5: The Nebula (Days 30-44)
**Space Journey**: Beautiful but disorienting fog, can't see far ahead.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Life might feel "boring" without constant stimulation. Silence feels uncomfortable. Waiting feels unbearable. Your brain is recalibrating to find joy in slower, deeper experiences. This is the attention span rebuilding.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're in the nebula. Life feels slow without the scroll. But this is healing - your brain learning that presence is better than distraction."

---

### Stage 6: Clear Space (Days 45-59)
**Space Journey**: Emerging from fog, Earth visible as tiny blue dot.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Focus is returning. You can read a book without checking your phone. Watch a movie without scrolling. Have a conversation while being fully present. Real presence is visible on the horizon.*

**Alex's Message**: "There it is. Home. Real presence. You can see it now. Your attention span is healing. Keep going."

---

### Stage 7: The Moon's Shadow (Days 60-74)
**Space Journey**: Moon in view, Earth growing larger, careful approach.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Mindful presence is becoming natural. The phone is a tool, not a master. But complacency is dangerous. One "quick check" can spiral into hours lost. Stay vigilant.*

**Alex's Message**: "So close now. Real presence, deep focus - they're right there. Don't let your guard down. The algorithm doesn't control us anymore."

---

### Stage 8: Earth Orbit (Days 75-89)
**Space Journey**: Circling home, Earth fills the viewport.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Digital minimalism is becoming automatic. Deep focus is available when you need it. Real presence is the default, not the exception. You're orbiting the life you want - fully lived, fully present.*

**Alex's Message**: "We're orbiting home. 90 days felt impossible once. Look at your attention span. Look at the moments you've actually lived."

---

### Stage 9: Homecoming (Day 90+)
**Space Journey**: Landing on Earth, hatch opens, sunlight streams in.

**Recovery Parallel**:
> *Attention habits are solidified. FOMO has no power. The phone serves you, not the other way around. The apps will always exist, but they don't control you anymore. Real life is where you live now.*

**Alex's Message**: "The hatch opens. Real presence. Deep focus. After 90 days, your attention is free. Welcome home."

## Time Reclaimed Integration

The gamification system can display social media-specific recovery stats:

- "Time reclaimed from not scrolling: [X] hours"
- "At your average screen time, you'd have lost [X] hours by now"
- "Days of full presence: [X]"
- "Attention span level: Recovering / Restored"

### Time Calculator
Based on user's historical social media usage (if tracked):
- Daily average screen time × Days clean = Hours reclaimed
- Show on dashboard as "Life hours saved"

---

## Notification Content

### Daily Journey Updates
- Morning: "Day [X] of presence. Your attention belongs to you today."
- Evening: "Another day fully lived. Day [X] of real presence."

### Trigger Moments
- Boredom: "Feeling the urge to scroll? That's your brain seeking easy dopamine. Sit with it. The urge will pass."
- Waiting: "Waiting feels uncomfortable without the phone. This discomfort is your attention span healing."

### Stage Transitions
- Entering Nebula: "Day 30. Life might feel slow without constant stimulation. This is your brain recalibrating. Embrace the silence."
- Entering Clear Space: "Day 45. Focus is returning. You can sustain attention again."

### Milestone Approaches
- Day before 90: "Tomorrow, you complete 90 days of presence. Attention fully reclaimed. Homecoming awaits."
