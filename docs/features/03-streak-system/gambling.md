## The 90-Day Science

The 90-day milestone for gambling addiction is based on:

- **Habit restructuring**: Breaking compulsive betting patterns requires consistent new behaviors
- **Financial recovery mindset**: Rebuilding healthy money relationships takes months
- **Dopamine regulation**: The brain's reward system needs time to find joy in non-gambling activities
- **Trigger desensitization**: Learning to experience triggers (sports, ads) without betting

This maps to Alex's 90-day journey - reaching Earth represents establishing a stable, gambling-free life foundation.
