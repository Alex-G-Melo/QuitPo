This file contains social media and phone addiction-specific content for the Streak System. See [README.md](README.md) for shared functionality.

## The 90-Day Science

The 90-day milestone for social media/phone addiction is based on:

- **Attention span recovery**: Fragmented attention from constant scrolling needs sustained practice to rebuild
- **FOMO extinction**: Fear of missing out diminishes when consistently not rewarded
- **Dopamine rebalancing**: The brain needs time to find reward in slower, deeper experiences
- **Habit replacement**: Building new idle-time habits takes consistent practice over months

This maps to Alex's 90-day journey - reaching Earth represents reclaiming your attention and presence.

## Time Tracking Integration

The streak system can show time reclaimed:

- "You've reclaimed approximately [X] hours in [days] days!"
- "At your average scroll time, you'd have lost [X] hours by now."
- "Your 30-day journey = a full work week of real life reclaimed."

---

## Notification Content (Social Media-Specific)

### Daily Updates
- Morning: "Day [X] of presence. Your attention belongs to you."
- Evening: "Another day of real life lived. Day [X]."

### Milestone Approach
- Day before 30: "Tomorrow is ONE MONTH of presence. Your focus is thanking you."
- Day before 90: "Tomorrow you complete the 90-day reset. Attention fully reclaimed."

### Post-Course Correction
- Day after: "The algorithm won yesterday. Today, you win. Day 1."
- Week after: "One week of presence restored. Focus rebuilding."
