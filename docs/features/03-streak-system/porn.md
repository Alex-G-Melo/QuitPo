## The 90-Day Science

Research indicates that approximately **90 days** is required for significant rewiring of neural pathways related to porn addiction. This is based on:

- **Dopamine receptor upregulation**: After chronic overstimulation, dopamine receptors need time to recover sensitivity
- **DeltaFosB protein reduction**: This addiction-related protein takes 6-8 weeks to significantly decrease
- **Prefrontal cortex recovery**: Executive function and impulse control improve over 2-3 months
- **Neuroplasticity timeline**: New neural pathways take approximately 90 days to solidify

This maps perfectly to Alex's 90-day journey home - reaching Earth represents completing the core neural rewiring period.

- "Flatline" period may occur (low libido)
- Brain recalibrating to normal stimulation

### Days 45-59: Clear Space
- Neural pathways substantially rewired

- Focus and motivation improved

### Days 60-74: Moon's Shadow
- Most addiction-related changes complete
- New habits becoming automatic
- Emotional regulation normalized

### Days 75-89: Earth Orbit

## Notification Content (Porn-Specific)

### Daily Updates
- Morning: "Day [X] of freedom. Your brain is healing."
- Evening: "Another day of rewiring complete. Day [X]."

### Milestone Approach
- Day before 30: "Tomorrow is ONE MONTH. Your dopamine receptors are thanking you."
- Day before 90: "Tomorrow you complete the 90-day reboot. Neural rewiring achieved."

### Post-Course Correction
- Day after: "Your brain didn't forget the healing. Day 1 of a fresh journey."
