## The 90-Day Science

The 90-day milestone for gaming addiction is based on:

- **Balance restoration**: Rebuilding life outside of games requires sustained new routines
- **Real-world reward systems**: The brain needs time to find fulfillment in slower, real achievements
- **Social reconnection**: Building offline relationships takes months of consistent effort
- **Habit replacement**: Filling gaming hours with real activities requires practice

This maps to Alex's 90-day journey - reaching Earth represents establishing a balanced life where gaming is optional, not compulsive.
