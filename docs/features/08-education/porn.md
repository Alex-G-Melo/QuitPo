## Module 1: The Science of Porn Addiction
**Duration**: ~45 minutes (8 lessons)

### Lesson 1: What is Addiction?
- Definition beyond substance abuse
- Behavioral addiction recognition
- The addiction cycle explained
- How porn qualifies as addictive

**Key Insight**: Addiction is about changes in brain chemistry, not moral weakness.

**Journal Prompt**: "When did you first realize porn might be a problem for you?"

### Lesson 2: The Dopamine System
- How dopamine works in the brain
- Reward pathway explanation
- Why internet porn hijacks this system
- The "supernormal stimulus" concept

**Key Insight**: Porn delivers dopamine hits far exceeding natural rewards.

**Journal Prompt**: "How has your response to normal pleasures changed over time?"

### Lesson 3: Tolerance & Escalation
- Why "more" is needed over time
- Escalation to extreme content
- The novelty factor in internet porn
- Desensitization explained

**Key Insight**: Escalation isn't a character flaw - it's how tolerance works.

**Journal Prompt**: "How has your content consumption escalated over time?"

### Lesson 4: The Prefrontal Cortex
- Executive function impairment
- Why willpower alone fails
- Decision-making disruption
- The "wanting vs liking" gap

**Key Insight**: Willpower is a limited resource; brain changes make quitting hard.

### Lesson 5: Triggers & Cues
- Environmental triggers (bedroom, late night)
- Emotional triggers (stress, boredom, loneliness)
- The HALT check (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)
- Conditioned dopamine responses

**Key Insight**: The urge is your brain's conditioned response - not a moral failing.

**Journal Prompt**: "What are YOUR top 3 triggers?"

### Lesson 6: The Role of Stress
- Stress-relief seeking behavior
- Cortisol and dopamine interaction
- The stress-use-guilt-stress cycle
- Why stress management matters

**Key Insight**: Porn often becomes a maladaptive stress coping mechanism.

### Lesson 7: Withdrawal Symptoms
- What to expect: brain fog, irritability, fatigue
- Timeline of acute withdrawal (weeks 1-2)
- The "flatline" period (weeks 4-8)
- Normalizing the experience

**Key Insight**: Withdrawal symptoms are temporary signs of healing.

**Journal Prompt**: "What withdrawal symptoms are you experiencing?"

### Lesson 8: Quiz
8 questions testing knowledge from Module 1.

## Module 2: Your Brain on Recovery
**Duration**: ~35 minutes (6 lessons)

### Lesson 1: The Neuroplasticity Promise
- Brain's ability to change at any age
- Creating new neural pathways
- The 90-day rewiring timeline
- Evidence from research

**Key Insight**: Your brain can heal. Science proves it.

### Lesson 2: Weeks 1-2: Initial Withdrawal
- Common symptoms: cravings, mood swings, insomnia
- Dopamine system recalibrating
- Coping strategies for this phase
- Why many quit here (and how to push through)

**Key Insight**: The first two weeks are hardest - it gets easier.

**Journal Prompt**: "How will you handle withdrawal symptoms this week?"

### Lesson 3: Weeks 3-4: Finding Balance
- Dopamine receptor upregulation beginning
- Mood stabilization signs
- New routines forming
- Early benefits emerging

### Lesson 4: Weeks 4-8: The Flatline
- What the flatline is (low libido, emotional flatness)
- Why it happens (dopamine recalibration)
- Why it's actually a good sign
- How long it typically lasts

**Key Insight**: The flatline is your brain resetting to normal - it's temporary.

**Journal Prompt**: "If you're in the flatline, how are you coping?"

### Lesson 5: Months 2-3: Deep Rewiring
- ΔFosB reduction timeline
- Receptor upregulation progress
- Benefits: focus, motivation, real attraction
- Preparing for long-term success

### Lesson 6: Quiz
6 questions testing knowledge from Module 2.

## Module 3: Relapse Prevention
**Duration**: ~40 minutes (7 lessons)

### Lesson 1: Understanding Relapse
- Relapse as process, not event
- The relapse chain: trigger → thought → craving → permission → use
- Warning signs days before acting out
- Breaking the chain early

**Key Insight**: Relapse often starts days before the actual event.

### Lesson 2: Building Your Defense System
- Environmental controls (blocking, device placement)
- Accountability structures (apps, partners)
- Support networks (community, therapy)
- Reducing opportunity

### Lesson 3: Coping Skills Toolkit
- Urge surfing technique (detailed guide)
- HALT check procedure
- Delay and distract strategies
- "Thinking through the action" technique

**Journal Prompt**: "What's your emergency plan for strong urges?"

### Lesson 4: High-Risk Situation Planning
- Identifying your personal danger zones
- Creating "if-then" plans
- Role-playing scenarios
- Emergency contacts list

**Journal Prompt**: "What are your 3 highest-risk situations?"

### Lesson 5: Managing Slip-Ups
- One slip ≠ total relapse
- The "abstinence violation effect"
- Damage limitation strategies
- Getting back on track immediately

**Key Insight**: How you respond to a slip determines what happens next.

### Lesson 6: Long-Term Maintenance
- Lifestyle changes for lasting recovery
- Ongoing support needs
- Staying vigilant without paranoia
- Building a life worth protecting

### Lesson 7: Quiz
7 questions testing knowledge from Module 3.

## Sample Quiz Questions

### Module 1 Questions

**Q1**: What happens to dopamine receptors with repeated porn use?
- They become more sensitive
- They stay the same
- **They become less sensitive (downregulation)** ✓
- They completely disappear

**Explanation**: Repeated dopamine floods cause receptors to downregulate (become less sensitive). This is why users need more extreme content over time.

**Q2**: HALT stands for:
- Happy, Attentive, Loving, Thoughtful
- **Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired** ✓
- Helpful, Aware, Listening, Teaching
- Hard, Adamant, Lost, Trembling

**Q3**: The prefrontal cortex is responsible for:
- Processing visual images
- **Decision-making and impulse control** ✓
- Storing memories
- Regulating sleep

### Module 2 Questions

**Q1**: The "flatline" period typically occurs during:
- Days 1-7
- Days 7-14
- **Weeks 4-8** ✓
- Months 4-6

**Q2**: ΔFosB is:
- A vitamin needed for recovery
- **A protein linked to addiction that decreases with abstinence** ✓
- A type of therapy
- A brain region
