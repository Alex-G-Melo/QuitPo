## Moderate Gaming Discussion

### Can You Game in Moderation?

Module 3, Lesson 6 addresses this honestly:

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Can you set a time limit and actually stop?
2. Can you go weeks without gaming when needed?
3. Does gaming enhance your life or replace it?
4. Are your real-life responsibilities handled first?
5. Do you feel worse or better after gaming?

**For Many:**
- Complete abstinence for 90+ days first
- Then honestly assess if moderation is possible
- Many find gaming triggers old patterns
- Some successfully moderate; some cannot

**The Test:**
- Can you play for 1 hour and walk away feeling good?
- Or does 1 hour become 5, leaving you feeling empty?

**Key Message**: Moderation is only for those who've done deep work and proven they can control the habit. For many, abstinence is easier than moderation.
