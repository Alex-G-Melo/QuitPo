## Addiction-Specific Messages

### Physical Consequences Messages
```
"Your brain fog will be worse if you continue.
Is it worth the next few days of mental haze?"

"Remember how you feel after. The dopamine crash
isn't worth these few minutes."

"Your future self will thank you for this pause."
```

### Relationship Messages
```
"Real connection beats pixels every time."

"What would it mean for your relationships
if you made a different choice right now?"

"The person you want to become doesn't need this."
```

### Brain Science Messages
```
"Your brain is rewiring right now. Every pause
helps build new neural pathways."

"The urge is just your old brain patterns.
You're building new ones with each good choice."

"This craving will pass in 10-15 minutes.
Can you wait it out?"
```

### Shame Prevention Messages
```
"This pause isn't about shame. It's about
choosing who you want to be."

"You're not weak for feeling this urge.
You're strong for pausing."

"Every successful deflection is a victory."
```

## Late Night Messages (10 PM - 6 AM)

Late night is the highest-risk time for pornography:

```
"It's late. This is when most relapses happen.
Your willpower is lower when you're tired."

"Night scrolling and browsing rarely ends well.
How about going to sleep instead?"

"Your tired brain is playing tricks on you.
Tomorrow-you will be grateful you stopped."

"The best decision right now is to put the
phone down and go to sleep."

"Nothing good happens on browsers at this hour.
We both know where this leads."
```

## Deflection Alternatives

When user chooses "Do Something Else":

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Great choice. What now?                    │
│                                             │
│  Physical Reset:                            │
│  [Cold water on face]                       │
│  [10 push-ups]                              │
│  [Step outside]                             │

│  [Talk to Alex]                             │
│  [Journal this urge]                        │
│                                             │
│  Redirect:                                  │
│  [Call someone]                             │

│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Pattern Detection

### High-Risk Pattern Recognition
```
If user triggers friction for browsers 3+ times in evening:
→ Alex message: "Looks like tonight is tough.
   Want to talk about what's going on?"

If user triggers friction right after bad check-in:
→ Alex message: "I know you're feeling {emotion}.
   This won't make it better."

If user triggers friction on same app daily at same time:
→ Suggest: "Consider blocking {app} during {time}?"
```

### Trigger Chain Detection
```
Pattern detected:
Instagram → Safari → Friction triggered

Insight: "Instagram often leads you to
browsers. Consider adding friction to
Instagram too, or blocking it entirely."
```

---

## Integration with Content Blocker

### Coordinated Protection
```
When friction fails and user continues to browser:
→ Content blocker provides second layer of defense

When content blocker blocks a site:
→ If user came from friction, log the full journey
→ Alex can reference: "The friction + blocker
   combo saved you today. Good setup."
```

---

## Effectiveness Tracking

### Metrics to Track
```
Deflection by:
- App (which apps have highest deflection?)
- Time of day (when does friction work best?)
- Message type (which messages resonate?)
- Streak day (is friction more effective early/late?)
- Previous friction outcome (does momentum matter?)
```

### Insights for User
```
"Your deflection rate is 67% — that means
friction is working! You're choosing
differently 2 out of 3 times."

"Late-night friction has 40% lower deflection.
Consider going to bed earlier or using
stricter blocking at night."

"Instagram has your lowest deflection rate.
Maybe consider blocking it entirely?"
```

---

## Alex Conversation Context

When user talks to Alex after friction:

```
Alex knows:
- Which app triggered friction
- What message was shown
- Whether user continued or deflected
- Recent friction history

Alex might say:
"I saw you paused before opening Safari.
What's going on tonight?"

"You've deflected from Instagram 3 times today.
That's real strength. How are you feeling?"

"I noticed you went to Safari after the
friction screen. No judgment — let's talk
about what happened."
```

---

## Premium Features

### Message Customization
```
Users can add personal messages:
- "Think about [partner name]"
- "[Personal mantra or reminder]"
- "Remember [specific consequence]"

Personal messages often have higher
deflection rates.
```

### Intensity Scaling
```
As user approaches risky patterns:
- Friction duration increases
- Messages become more direct
- Multiple breath cycles required

Example: Third friction in 30 minutes:
→ 15-second duration (vs normal 10)
→ Message: "This is the third time.
   Something is really pulling at you.
   Let's talk to Alex instead."
```
