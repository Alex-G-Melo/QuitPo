## Addiction-Specific Messages

### Presence Messages
```
"What's happening in your actual life
right now that deserves your attention?"

"You have one life. Is scrolling really
how you want to spend this moment?"

"Your attention is the most valuable thing
you have. Algorithms don't deserve it."
```

### FOMO Messages
```
"FOMO is a lie. Nothing on here is more
important than your real life."

"What you're 'missing' is curated fiction.
Real moments are happening around you."

"The feed will be here later.
This moment in your life won't."
```

### Comparison Messages
```
"You're comparing your reality to everyone's
highlight reel. That's never a fair fight."

"The people you're envying are also
scrolling and feeling inadequate."

"Your life is worth living, not comparing."
```

### Attention Messages
```
"Every notification costs 20+ minutes of focus.
Is this one worth it?"

"Your attention span is recovering.
This scroll could set it back."

"Deep work requires presence.
Scrolling trains distraction."
```

### Connection Messages
```
"1000 followers doesn't equal one real friend."

"When did you last have a real conversation
with someone you care about?"

"Virtual likes < one real hug."
```

---

## Time-Awareness Messages

### Morning Messages (Before 9 AM)
```
"Starting your day with scrolling?
There might be a better first activity."

"Morning phone use sets the tone.
Choose intention over algorithm."

"What if you didn't check your phone
for the first 30 minutes today?"
```

### Work Hours Messages (9 AM - 5 PM)
```
"Is this a break, or procrastination?
Be honest with yourself."

"Your focus could use protection right now.
Maybe later?"

"The algorithm will still be here after work."
```

### Evening Messages (5 PM - 10 PM)
```
"Evening is for real connection.
Who could you call instead?"

"Your eyes and brain need a break from screens.
Try something analog."

"Dinner and presence > dinner and scrolling."
```

### Late Night Messages (10 PM - 6 AM)
```
"Blue light and stimulation are keeping you awake.
Your sleep matters."

"Late-night scrolling makes tomorrow worse.
Go to bed instead."

"Nothing on social media is worth sacrificing sleep."
```

## Deflection Alternatives

When user chooses "Do Something Else":

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Real life is waiting.                      │
│                                             │
│  Connect for real:                          │
│  [Call someone]                             │
│  [Send a voice message to a friend]         │
│  [Go see someone in person]                 │
│                                             │
│  Be present:                                │
│  [Go outside for 5 minutes]                 │
│  [Look around your actual surroundings]     │
│  [Just sit and breathe]                     │
│                                             │
│  Use your hands:                            │
│  [Read a physical book]                     │
│  [Write something on paper]                 │
│  [Make something]                           │
│                                             │
│  [Talk to Alex]                             │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Pickup-Specific Friction

### First Pickup of Day
```
"This is your first phone unlock.
Do you really need social media right now?"

"Morning intention setting: What do you
actually want to do with this unlock?"
```

### Frequent Pickups
```
"This is your 10th unlock in the last hour.
Something's pulling at you. What is it?"

"You're picking up your phone a lot.
Are you avoiding something?"

"Habitual checking won't give you what you need.
What are you actually looking for?"
```

---

## Pattern Detection

### High-Risk Pattern Recognition
```
If friction triggers 5+ times in one hour:
→ "You're in a scroll loop. Break it by
   putting the phone in another room."

If friction always triggers after meals:
→ "Post-meal scrolling is a habit pattern.
   Try a short walk instead."

If friction triggers when user reported lonely:
→ "Social media often makes loneliness worse.
   Call a real person instead."
```

### Boredom Detection
```
If friction triggers with rapid app-switching:
→ "Switching between apps looking for stimulation?
   Your brain needs a real break, not more content."
```

---

## Alex Conversation Context

When user talks to Alex after friction:

```
Alex knows:
- Which app triggered friction
- How many pickups today
- User's reported mood
- Typical usage patterns

Alex might say:
"You've opened Instagram 8 times today and
deflected 5 times. That's great progress.
What's drawing you in?"

"I noticed you're checking TikTok a lot
during work hours. Is something going on?"

"Your pickups are way up today. Usually that
means you're stressed or bored. Which is it?"
```

---

## Premium Features

### App-Specific Insights
```
"Your Instagram deflection rate: 45%
Your TikTok deflection rate: 20%

TikTok has your attention hard. Consider:
- Deleting it entirely
- Using app limit (not just friction)
- Blocking specific content types"
```

### Time Reclaimed Tracker
```
"Today's deflections saved you approximately:
- 45 minutes of scrolling
- 23 brain-fragmenting interruptions

This week you've reclaimed: 3h 20m"
```

### Replacement Activity Logging
```
After choosing "Do Something Else":
"What did you do instead?"

[Went outside]
[Called someone]
[Read something]
[Just sat quietly]
[Other: ___]

Track over time: "When you replace scrolling
with calling someone, your mood improves 40%."
```

## Friction Intensity Scaling

### Based on Usage Patterns
```
Light user (< 1 hour social/day):
- 5-second friction
- Gentle messages
- Minimal intervention

Moderate user (1-3 hours social/day):
- 10-second friction
- Encouraging messages
- Standard intervention

Heavy user (3+ hours social/day):
- 15-second friction
- Direct messages
- Suggest additional features (blocking, limits)
```

### Time-of-Day Scaling
```
Morning (before 9 AM): +5 seconds
Late night (after 10 PM): +5 seconds
After 3+ pickups in an hour: +5 seconds
```

---

## Grayscale Integration

### Optional Grayscale Mode
```
When friction triggers:
- Phone automatically switches to grayscale
- Returns to color if user chooses "Do Something Else"
- Stays grayscale if user continues to app

Rationale: Colors are designed to grab attention.
Grayscale makes scrolling less compelling.
```
