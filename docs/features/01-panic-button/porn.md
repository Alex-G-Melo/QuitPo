## Motivational Messages

Messages are designed for typewriter animation — short, warm, supportive. The tone is like a caring friend, not a drill sergeant.

### Grounding/Self-Awareness (Shown First)

```
"Hey. Look at yourself."
"See your face right now."
"This is who you really are."
"You are not the urge."
"Come back to the moment."
"Stay with me."
"Take a deep breath."
"Feel your feet on the ground."
"You are here. Right now."
"Breathe in... breathe out."
"Ground yourself."
```

### Neural Science

```
"Your brain is playing tricks."
"This is just dopamine talking."
"It's a chemical reaction, not you."
"Your rational mind will return."
"Urges peak, then they fade."
"90 days to rewire. You're healing."
"Every 'no' builds new pathways."
"Your brain can heal from this."
"Neuroplasticity is on your side."
"You're retraining your brain."
"This feeling is temporary."
```

### Progress-Based

```
"{X} days of healing."
"Don't throw that away."
"{X} days strong. Keep going."
"You promised yourself this."
"Honor your journey."
"Just one more day."
"Look how far you've come."
```

### Identity-Based

"Be the person you're becoming."
"Remember why you started."
"Think of {person}."
"Make yourself proud."
"Your future self is cheering."
"You're becoming someone new."
```

### Consequence-Based

```
"You know how this story ends."
"The regret isn't worth it."
"Minutes of relief, days of regret."
"You've felt this shame before."
"Choose differently this time."
"There's a better path forward."
```

### Empowerment

```

"This feeling will pass."
"It always does."
"You've got this."

"Thousands are fighting with you."
```
