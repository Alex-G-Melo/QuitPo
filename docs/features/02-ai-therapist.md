# AI Therapist

## Title
24/7 AI-Powered Recovery Support Companion

## Description
The AI Therapist (branded as "Melius" in competitor apps) is a conversational AI companion available around the clock to provide emotional support, coping strategies, and therapeutic guidance. Unlike human therapists with limited availability and high costs, the AI offers immediate, judgment-free support whenever users need it most - including late nights and weekends when urges often peak. The AI uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, motivational interviewing, and addiction-specific guidance.

## Problem Statement

Users struggling with porn addiction face several barriers to getting support:

1. **Timing**: Urges don't follow business hours. Strongest urges often hit late at night or on weekends when human support is unavailable.

2. **Shame Barrier**: Many users feel too embarrassed to discuss their struggle with another human, even a therapist. The stigma prevents them from seeking help.

3. **Cost**: Regular therapy sessions cost $100-200+ per session. Most people can't afford weekly sessions long-term.

4. **Availability**: Even with a therapist, users can't call them at 2 AM when struggling. Between-session support is limited.

5. **Consistency**: Human advice varies. Users benefit from consistent, evidence-based guidance that doesn't change based on the therapist's mood.

6. **Immediacy**: When experiencing an urge, users need help NOW - not in 3 days when they can schedule an appointment.

### 1. Instant Availability

### Example Conversations

**Scenario: User Having an Urge**

```
User: I'm having a really strong urge right now

AI: I hear you. Urges can feel overwhelming, but
    remember - they always pass. You're doing the
    right thing by reaching out instead of acting
    on it.

    Let's work through this together. Can you tell
    me:
    - Where are you right now?
    - What were you doing when the urge started?
    - On a scale of 1-10, how strong is it?

User: I'm at home alone. Was just scrolling on my
      phone. It's like an 8.

AI: Being alone at home with your phone is a
    high-risk situation - and you recognized it.
    That awareness is huge.

    For an urge at level 8, let's try something
    immediate. Can you:

    1. Put your phone in another room for 5 minutes
    2. Do 10 jumping jacks or pushups
    3. Splash cold water on your face

    Physical movement breaks the mental loop.

    I'll be here when you come back. You've got
    this - you're on day 12 and you've overcome
    urges before.

User: Ok did the jumping jacks. Feel a bit better.

AI: That's excellent! Movement works because it
    redirects the dopamine system.

    How would you rate the urge now?

User: Maybe a 5 now

AI: Good progress! From 8 to 5 in just a few
    minutes.

    Now that it's more manageable, let's look at
    what led to this. You mentioned scrolling your
    phone - were you on social media?

User: Yeah, Instagram

AI: Instagram is a common trigger. The algorithm
    often surfaces suggestive content that can
    start the urge cascade.

    Have you configured Instagram's sensitive
    content settings? There's a guide in the app
    that can help you "reset" your algorithm to
    show less triggering content.

    Would you like me to walk you through it, or
    would you prefer to keep talking about how
    you're feeling?
```

**Scenario: Post-Relapse Support**

```
User: I relapsed last night

AI: Thank you for telling me. That took courage.

    First: this doesn't erase your progress. The
    14 days you built weren't wasted - those
    neural pathways you were forming are still
    there.

    How are you feeling right now?

User: Terrible. Like a failure.

AI: Those feelings are valid, but let's separate
    the behavior from your identity. You SLIPPED.
    You are not a failure.

    Research shows that relapses are often part
    of recovery - what matters is how you respond
    to them.

    Can you tell me what happened? Understanding
    the trigger helps prevent next time.

User: I was stressed about work, couldn't sleep,
      and just... gave in

AI: Stress + sleep deprivation is one of the most
    challenging combinations. Your willpower was
    already depleted.

    Let's think about what you could do
    differently next time when you notice you're
    stressed and can't sleep:

    1. Use the panic button BEFORE opening any
       risky apps
    2. Try a breathing exercise to calm your
       nervous system
    3. Call someone or message in the community
    4. Put your phone in another room entirely

    Which of these feels most realistic to try
    next time?

User: Probably the breathing or calling someone

AI: Good choices. Let's make a concrete plan:

    "When I notice I'm stressed and can't sleep,
    instead of reaching for my phone, I will do
    a 5-minute breathing exercise first."

    Would you like to try a breathing exercise
    right now? It might help with how you're
    feeling.
```

**Scenario: General Check-in**

```
User: Just checking in. Day 30 today.

AI: Day 30! 🎉 That's a major milestone. You've
    made it through the hardest part of the
    rewiring process.

    Research shows that around day 30, many
    people notice:
    - Improved focus and clarity
    - More stable mood
    - Better sleep quality
    - Increased motivation

    Have you noticed any of these changes?

User: Actually yeah, I do feel more focused at
      work

AI: That's your prefrontal cortex coming back
    online! Porn consumption hijacks the brain's
    reward system, making it harder to focus on
    things that aren't immediately rewarding.

    You're literally rebuilding that capacity.

    What would you like to do with your improved
    focus? Any goals you've been putting off?

User: I've wanted to learn guitar for years

AI: Perfect! Learning an instrument is excellent
    for recovery - it gives your brain healthy
    dopamine hits through skill progression.

    Plus, practicing guitar when you feel an urge
    is a great redirect strategy.

    Have you thought about getting started? Even
    15 minutes a day makes a difference.

### Safety Guardrails

**If user mentions self-harm or suicide:**
```
I'm concerned about what you're sharing. Your
safety matters most.

Please reach out to a crisis line:
• National Suicide Prevention: 988
• Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

Would you like me to stay with you while you
reach out?
```

**If user asks for explicit content:**
```
I'm here to help with your recovery journey,
and I can't help with that kind of request.

Is there something else going on that made you
ask that? Sometimes seeking out content is a
sign of an urge or difficult emotions.
```

## Example Quick Reply Responses

**"I'm struggling with an urge"**
```
I'm here for you. Urges are tough, but they're also
temporary - usually peaking and fading within
15-20 minutes.

Right now, let's focus on getting through this
moment. What does this urge feel like in your body?
```

**"Just want to talk"**
```
Of course! I'm always here to listen.

What's on your mind today?
```

**"Need coping strategies"**
```
Absolutely. Here are some evidence-based strategies:

**In the moment (urges):**
• 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (5 things you see, 4 hear...)
• Cold water on face/hands
• Physical movement (pushups, walk)
• Call someone

**Long-term (prevention):**
• Identify your triggers
• Create "if-then" plans
• Build healthy dopamine sources
• Improve sleep hygiene

Which area would you like to explore?
```

**"Feeling great today!"**
```
That's wonderful to hear! 🌟

Days like today are building the foundation for
your new life.
