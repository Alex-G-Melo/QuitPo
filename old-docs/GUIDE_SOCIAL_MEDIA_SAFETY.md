# Social Media Safety Setup Guides

## Overview

Since QuitPo cannot directly filter content inside third-party social media apps, we provide step-by-step guides for users to configure each platform's built-in safety settings. This empowers users to take control of their algorithm and reduce triggering content.

---

## Why This Matters

Social media platforms use algorithms that can surface triggering content. By properly configuring these settings, users can:

- **Reset their algorithm** to stop showing suggestive content
- **Enable content filters** that block adult/sensitive material
- **Limit personalization** that leads to progressively explicit content
- **Control who can contact them** to avoid explicit DMs

## Instagram Safety Guide

### Step 1: Enable Sensitive Content Control

1. Go to your **Profile** (bottom right)
2. Tap the **three lines** (☰) in the top right
3. Select **"Settings and privacy"**
4. Scroll to **"Suggested content"**
5. Tap **"Sensitive content"**
6. Select **"Less"** (strictest option)

> This tells Instagram to show fewer posts that may contain sensitive content in Explore and Reels.

### Step 2: Clear Your Algorithm

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Your activity"**
3. Select **"Time spent"**
4. Tap **"Clear Instagram recommendation history"**

> This resets the content Instagram thinks you want to see.

### Step 3: Hide Suggested Content

1. When you see triggering content in Explore or Reels:
   - Tap the **three dots** (⋮)
   - Select **"Not interested"**
2. Repeat consistently for a few days
3. Instagram will learn to stop showing similar content

### Step 4: Restrict Story Replies

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Messages and story replies"**
3. Under "Story replies," select **"People you follow"** or **"Off"**

### Step 5: Filter DM Requests

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Messages and story replies"**
3. Enable **"Filter offensive words and phrases"**
4. Under "Message requests," consider setting to **"People you follow"**

### Step 6: Limit Reels (Optional but Recommended)

1. Consider unfollowing accounts that post triggering content
2. Mute or restrict accounts instead of following
3. Avoid the Explore tab entirely (use Direct URL access)

### Pro Tips for Instagram

- **Don't linger** on triggering content - it trains the algorithm
- **Immediately scroll past** any suggestive content
- **Use the "Not interested" button** aggressively
- **Consider a new account** if your algorithm is heavily polluted

## TikTok Safety Guide

### Step 1: Enable Restricted Mode

1. Open **Profile** (bottom right)
2. Tap the **three lines** (☰) in the top right
3. Select **"Settings and privacy"**
4. Go to **"Content preferences"**
5. Enable **"Restricted Mode"**
6. Set a passcode you'll forget (write it in QuitPo's notes)

> Restricted Mode limits mature content and can't be easily disabled.

### Step 2: Filter Video Keywords

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Content preferences"**
3. Select **"Filter video keywords"**
4. Add triggering words/hashtags you want to block

- (add terms specific to your triggers)

### Step 3: Clear Watch History

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Activity center"** or **"Watch history"**
3. Delete all watch history
4. Consider doing this weekly

### Step 4: Long Press "Not Interested"

1. On any triggering video, **long press**
2. Select **"Not interested"**
3. Choose **"Hide videos from this creator"**
4. Do this immediately - don't watch the video

### Step 5: Adjust For You Feed

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Content preferences"**
3. Select **"Refresh your For You feed"**

> This resets your recommendations entirely.

### Step 6: Limit Screen Time in TikTok

1. Go to **Settings and privacy**
2. Tap **"Digital wellbeing"**
3. Enable **"Daily screen time limit"**
4. Set to 30-60 minutes max

### Pro Tips for TikTok

- TikTok's algorithm is extremely fast - a few seconds watching trains it
- **Scroll past instantly** if you see something triggering
- Consider deleting TikTok entirely if it's a major trigger
- Use **Following tab** instead of For You

## Twitter/X Safety Guide

### Step 1: Enable Safe Search

1. Tap your **Profile icon** → **Settings and privacy**
2. Go to **"Privacy and safety"**
3. Tap **"Content you see"**
4. Enable **"Hide sensitive content"**

### Step 2: Block Sensitive Media

- (customize to your triggers)

### Step 4: Protect DMs

2. Tap **"Privacy and safety"**
3. Select **"Direct messages"**
4. Enable **"Filter low-quality messages"**
5. Consider disabling DMs from people you don't follow

### Step 5: Curate Your Timeline

1. Unfollow accounts that post triggering content
2. Use **Lists** for news/topics (bypasses algorithmic timeline)
3. Mute accounts instead of following if needed

### Pro Tips for Twitter/X

- Turn off **"Show the best Tweets first"** to reduce algorithmic content
- The Explore tab is dangerous - avoid it
- Use browser + content blocker instead of native app for more control

---

## YouTube Safety Guide

### Step 1: Enable Restricted Mode

1. Tap your **Profile picture**
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Tap **"General"**
4. Enable **"Restricted Mode"**

> This filters out potentially mature content.

### Step 2: Clear Watch History

1. Go to **Settings** → **History and privacy**

3. On mobile, immediately swipe past any triggering Short
4. Tap **"Not interested"** consistently

### Pro Tips for YouTube

- Sign out to get generic recommendations (less personalized)
- Use separate accounts for different purposes
- Watch time matters - leaving a video paused still counts
- YouTube Kids is too restrictive but demonstrates what's possible

---

### Step 3: Leave NSFW Subreddits

1. Review your subscribed subreddits
2. Leave any that contain triggering content
3. Many seemingly innocent subreddits can become triggers

### Step 4: Use Old Reddit (Desktop)

2. Less algorithmic, more chronological
3. NSFW filter is more robust

### Step 5: Disable Personalized Recommendations

1. Settings → **Account Settings**
2. Disable **"Personalize recommendations based on your activity"**

### Pro Tips for Reddit

---

## Discord Safety Guide

3. Many gaming/community servers have hidden NSFW channels

### Step 4: Disable Server Discovery

1. Settings → **Privacy & Safety**
2. Disable suggestions and recommendations

### Pro Tips for Discord

- Discord is primarily for communities - be selective about which servers you join
- NSFW channels require explicit opt-in, but some servers require it
- Consider using Discord only for specific, safe communities

---

## General Tips (All Platforms)

### The Nuclear Options

If a platform is too triggering, consider:

1. **Delete the app entirely** - Most extreme but most effective
2. **Use web version only** - Harder to access, more friction
3. **Time restrictions** - QuitPo's Screen Time feature + platform limits
4. **Account reset** - Create new account with clean algorithm

### Algorithm Training Takes Time

- Most platforms need 1-2 weeks of consistent "Not interested" signals
- Don't give up after a few days
- Every interaction matters - even hovering or pausing

### The Scroll Trap

- Platforms are designed to be endless
- Set hard time limits
- Use QuitPo's friction feature before opening these apps

### Late Night = High Risk

- Algorithm shows more engaging (often suggestive) content at night
- Platforms know you're more vulnerable when tired
- Consider blocking access after 10 PM

## Implementation Notes

### Content Updates

These guides will need periodic updates as platforms change their UIs and settings. Consider:

- Store guide content in a CMS or remote config
- Version guides with last-updated dates
- Allow in-app updates without app store review

### Screenshots

- Include annotated screenshots for each step
- Update screenshots when platforms change
- Consider using step-by-step animations

### Localization

- Platform settings names differ by language
- May need region-specific guides (EU has different privacy options)

### Tracking Completion

```typescript
interface SafetyGuideProgress {
  platform: 'instagram' | 'tiktok' | 'twitter' | 'youtube' | 'snapchat' | 'reddit' | 'discord';
  stepsCompleted: number[];
  completedAt?: Date;
  needsUpdate?: boolean;  // Platform UI changed
}
```
